# Angular Labs

This repository contains the Angular lab exercises. They are managed under 2 distinct branches : 

* [Exercise](https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/angular-labs/tree/exercise) : skeleton of the Angular exercises from where the students will start.
* [Solution](https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/angular-labs/tree/solution) : what we expect to have at the end of the exercise.
